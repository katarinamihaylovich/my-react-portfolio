# my-react-portfolio

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create an online portfolio for myself using React so that a potential employer would be able to take a look at some of my coding work projects. I wanted to make the application a single-page application with Header, Footer, and Navigation elements, and buttons to bring me to the following sections: About Me, Home, Portfolio, and Contact. To accomplish this, I created components in JS that would render in HTML format, I created some CSS rules, and I used State to create funcitonal rendering. What I learned most from this project was how React works, how HTML and JavaScript work together, and conditional rendering. 


## Technology Used:

1. Javascript
