# my-react-portfolio

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create an online portfolio for myself using React so that a potential employer would be able to take a look at some of my coding work projects. I wanted to make the application a single-page application with Header, Footer, and Navigation elements, and buttons to bring me to the following sections: About Me, Home, Portfolio, and Contact.
